Hello World! and Welcome one and all, big and small.

My name is Vinicius Siqueira Frasson and I'm a 21 years old who just about started his career as a programmer/developer of applications, games and websites.

Despite my late beginning in the tech field, I have a soft spot for learning and trying new things, so much in fact, 
that i have a bachelor's degree as a chemistry technician (as part of my integrated technical high school education in the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina) 
and a soon to be bachelor's degree in biological sciences (courtesy of my time studying in the Federal University of Santa Catarina), 
both completely different sciences, and both having little to nothing in the way of software development and programming.

So just to elaborate a little further on my education and why i have such a diverse set of skills, I stopped pursuing my careers in both chemistry and biology 
meanly because after studying them and understanding the career path they offer, I couldn’t see myself working in that field, or in other words, 
they just didn’t clicked with me. But still, I'm grateful for the opportunities they gave me and think that despite all, I carry a lot of what I learned with them.

Alas, by the lower half of a year I been interested in programming, and in that time i’ve been familiarized myself with the language Lua, and web design in general 
(CSS3 AND HTML5), thanks to a course by CPDI (Committee for democratization of information), soon learning Java with them as well. 
But that’s only the beginning, because I intend on continuing my studies in any way possible.

In conclusion, I'm excited to enter the market, having high expectations in my abilities and capabilities as a promising up-and-coming developer.
