Hello World! and Welcome one and all, big and small.

My name is Vinicius Siqueira Frasson and I'm a 21 years old who just about started his career as a programmer/developer of applications, games and websites.

Despite my late beginning in the tech field, I have a soft spot for learning and trying new things, so much in fact, 
that i have a bachelor's degree as a chemistry technician (as part of my integrated technical high school education in the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina) 
and a soon to be bachelor's degree in biological sciences (courtesy of my time studying in the Federal University of Santa Catarina), 
both completely different sciences, and both having little to nothing in the way of software development and programming.

To wrap-up those degrees i mentioned above, I stopped pursuing my careers in both chemistry and biology meanly because after studying them and understanding the career path they offer,
I couldn’t see myself working in those fields, or in other words, they just didn’t clicked with me. 
That being said, I'm grateful for the opportunities i had and think that despite all, I carry a lot of what I learned during that time.

Alas, while serching for new carrer options I took a interested in programming, and since then i’ve familiarized myself with the language Lua, and web design (CSS3 AND HTML5), 
thanks to a course by CPDI (Committee for democratization of information), soon learning Java with them as well. 
But that’s only the beginning, because I intend on continuing my studies in other ways.

So in conclusion, I'm excited to enter the market, having high expectations in my abilities and capabilities as a promising up-and-coming developer.
